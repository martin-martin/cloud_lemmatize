# cloud_lemmatize
Using a pipeline and an API to find POS and Lemmas for a ton of words in some languages

[meaningcloud](https://www.meaningcloud.com/developer/lemmatization-pos-parsing/doc/2.0) offers a great service for cloud-based POS tagging (and more).
I've used it to improve the lemmatization lists from [lexiconista](http://www.lexiconista.com/datasets/lemmatization/), which I noticed had some wrong lemmatizations in them.
